## An Intro

Hola Amigo! 

Before I embark on my endless rambling of techtalk and banter, I wanted to first introduce myself and tell you why I started this blog that you're reading. These views I express are mine and not my employer. Disclaimer: I am by no means an author or a writer. I am simply here to share my opinions and interests. I make mistakes and definitley do not have perfect grammar. :) OK, carry on.

I'm Dan Furtaw. Husband, Dad, Friend, and a guy who loves to do cool shit. While I don't think I have a necessarily accomplished career, I certainly have worked some cool jobs alongside some really smart people. I'll go into more detail in a minute, but before I do, I wanted to state my reason(s) for starting this blog; 

1) I hope it will serve as a helpful tool for others who work on similar tools or projects and generate some ideas that will help in your tech journey
2) I love reading about other folks careers and maybe someone will find this interesting. I also want my kids to be able to look back on what their old man did one day if they're ever curious. So, yeah. Onward!

Feel free to skip this section. I only include this so that my readers can understand my thinking that is derived from my past experiences. My career has kept a pretty consistent theme: #monitoring. This is a theme that took effect in my first job post-college. I began a developmental program at a financial services firm based in Florida. 

### Raymond James
Here, I was exposed to the IT and Cyber monitoring throughout the company and worked as a Site Reliability Engineer. When I tell you this was a challenging role for a recent College grad, I mean it... Fast forward to the end of the pgrogram, I ended up working as a Linux admin for close to a year. Eventually, I knew that I wanted to move into Cybersecurity.

I was very interested in Cyber, but I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do specifically within the field. A year into a Masters in Cybersecurity was about all the "creds" I had for the job. No certifications or direct work experience made it tough, but, that's where knowing the right people paid off. A couple of friends mentioned an opening on their team as an administrator of a tool I had worked with in the past called Splunk, and the rest was history. I worked as a Splunk admin for about 2 years and loved it. This was particularly fun because I was challenged but I also learned how valuable the platform was to the company I was at. An internal restructuring meant I would be working side by side with the traditional "SOC" members and the ancillary groups like Vulnerability Management, Hunt, and Threat Intelligence. After being exposed to this, I wanted to try out more of a "blue team" oriented role, so when the opportunity came about, I took it. I worked as an Incident Responder for a few months and learned a whole new side of technology. I enjoyed my time but ultimately felt like I was pulled away from my passion which was working with Splunk. 

### Nielsen 
I knew I wanted a change and to see how others did things so I took a role as a Splunk Engineer at a local Media company. I worked alongside some brilliant Engineers and got to automate, automate, automate (Ansible and Terraform r sick, btw). Things were great, but the future was uncertain after the company was acquired, so fast forward to #RaymondJames pt. 2. I was welcomed back to Raymond James as an Engineer, this was the first time I was put in a position of leadership where I was expected to help train and mentor others and I loved it. My time at Raymond James this time was cut short after a Linkedin job description popped up on my screen that looked like it had been made just for me. All jokes aside, it was a big career jump with another highly reputable company, so I took a chance and joined the SIEM Engineering team at 

### Verizon 
This job called for extremely specific experience which was knowing best practices on various SIEM tools (Splunk, RSA Netwitness, QRadar, Chronice, Sentinel) and Cybersecurity. Verizon provided a great service and I learned a ton working with their customers. Writing detections and providing consultation on SIEM tools was my daily role and man... it was a good time. But that brings me to my last career move, and one that I had in the back of my mind for years. 

### Splunk 
I knew that I wanted to get as close to the source as possible, which meant working for Splunk when the time was right. Thanks to a friend I had made in a previous position, I found out about a super interesting and challenging opportunity on the Sales side (this was totally new to me). I gave it a try and interviewed for the position. Splunk's interview process is lengthy and requires you to demo to a panel. As a practicioner, I wasn't used to this type of presentation so I practiced, practiced again, then practiced 50 more times (my wife probably memorized my presentation) and ultimately was given a chance to come aboard. As I'm writing this, I'm 3 months in to working as a Sales Engineer and I can honestly say that it is the most fun and challenging job I've ever had. The culture here is amazing. I had never considered a role in Sales and I have even heard some folks call this role an "accidental profession", but long story short, I currently help customers find value with Splunk. I get to build and I get to network with people in tech, two things that I love doing.

Now that you know a little bit about me and how I ended up here, I'm excited to write about a few things that I wish I had known throughout the past few years and some other neat things that interest me. See ya!
